## 👋 About Me

I'm **Nate J. Swenson**, a results-driven professional specializing in Cloud and AWS with a strong focus on DevOps practices. With a solid background in software development and infrastructure management, I excel in leveraging cloud technologies to optimize system performance, scalability, and reliability.

Throughout my career, I have successfully designed and implemented cloud-based solutions on AWS, utilizing services such as EC2, S3, Lambda, EKS, ECS, and CloudFormation. I am highly skilled in infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles and have extensive experience with Terraform, enabling streamlined provisioning and automation of cloud resources.

Furthermore, I have expertise in deploying and managing applications in containerized environments using Kubernetes on AWS EKS. I have worked with Docker extensively, ensuring efficient container orchestration and seamless application deployment. Most recently leveraging ArgoCD to manage EKS deployments.

My proficiency extends to monitoring and troubleshooting cloud environments using AWS CloudWatch and other monitoring tools such as DataDog to ensure high availability and optimal performance. I am also skilled in implementing security best practices and maintaining compliance in AWS environments.

As a motivated professional, I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with cross-functional teams to drive successful cloud deployments and DevOps practices. I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and stay abreast of the latest advancements in cloud technologies.
